    "about": "I am Chirag Surendra, an Associate Consultant with a strong focus on Frontend Development, passionate about building performant, scalable, and intuitive web applications. I specialize in React.js, where I continuously explore new techniques to enhance user experience and application efficiency.\n\nCurrently, I work in the insurance domain, where I have developed a dynamic data entry table capable of handling multiple business conditions. The table integrates seamlessly with standardized code tables (reference data models), ensuring accurate and consistent data handling across the application. I also regularly work on proofs of concept (POCs) related to React.js, which help strengthen my technical depth and problem-solving skills in modern frontend frameworks.\n\nBeyond my project work, I actively participate in my organization’s tech innovation programs, where I’ve collaborated on new ideas and contributed to small-scale product prototypes. These experiences have enhanced my ability to think creatively and apply engineering principles to real-world challenges./nDriven by curiosity and continuous learning, I aim to deepen my expertise in frontend engineering, while expanding into cloud-based architectures and modern web performance optimization.",
