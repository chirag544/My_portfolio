    "about": "I am Chirag Surendra, a Frontend Developer passionate about building responsive, efficient, and high-performance web applications. I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing user experience, and continuously sharpening my technical expertise.\n\n At MSG Global Solutions, I focus on React development, where I improved UI performance through virtualized data tables, React.memo, and lazy loading. I also developed a reusable form builder with validation, reducing development effort and minimizing user input errors.\n\n Previously, during my internship at A.P. Moller Maersk, I gained hands-on experience with Java and Spring Boot, where I built and optimized RESTful APIs with pagination, proxy services, and real-time monitoring using Grafana and Prometheus. This strengthened my backend foundation while contributing to more reliable and scalable systems.\n\n Beyond work, I enjoy playing cricket, listening to podcasts, and reading books. Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my expertise in cloud computing and distributed systems, working on impactful projects that drive innovation and efficiency.\"\n     ",
